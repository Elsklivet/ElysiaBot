AUTHOR(S): Elsklivet#8867 (Gavin Heinrichs) [348235152972972042], Disappointment Incarnate#1101 (Josh Ye) [135151101015097344]
DATE CREATED: 5 Sep 2019
USER ID: 619279373404602381
DESCRIPTION: Elysia is an all purpose bot created by Gavin Heinrichs (Elsklivet/KaiserHeinrichs) with the intent to be both
            fun and helpful, containing both utility commands and chat commands that function as jokes. The bot was also
            designed to be a learning experience, as it is the authors' first project in JavaScript outside of a pong game.
